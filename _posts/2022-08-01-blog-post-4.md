Repository [BirthDeathProcess.jl](https://github.com/josemanuel22/BirthDeathProcess.jl)  process is a package in julia that implements a series of utilities to simulate the Birth-Death process, given by the differential equation $$ n' = \beta - d\cdot n $$.

Two algorithms are implemented for the resolution of this simple ODE. In the first place, a classical numerical integration algorithm of the [Runge-Kutta](http://users.uoa.gr/~tsitourasc/RK54_new_v2.pdf) type and secondly, the well-known [Gillespie](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0021999176900413?via%3Dihub) Monte-Carlo dynamic algorithm is implemented.


## Birth-Death Process

- Simple model of population dynamics called a birth-death processes. Population fluctuations (birth and death rates, $$\beta_{birth}$$ and $$\beta_{death}$$) depend only on the population size, $$n$$.

- Letâ€™s consider the following situation: protein synthesis. The rate at which the population increases depends only on the presence of the ingredients and is thus is fixed and a clearance rate (deaths) is proportional to the total population, $$n$$.

- So we have two possible events: births (or synthesis) and deaths (or decays):

\begin{equation}
\beta_{birth} = (constant),\quad
\beta_{death}  = (k_0)*n.
\end{equation}

- $$\beta_{birth}$$  and $$(k_0)$$ are parameters of the model that would, in principle, be determined by experimental measurements. Both rates have units of [events/time]. From now on we will denote by $$d$$ the parameter $k_0$.

- Deterministically, the population size $$n$$ can be described by the ordinary differential equation:
\begin{equation}
n'(t) = \beta - d \cdot n(t).
\end{equation}
- Solving this differential equation we get:
\begin{equation}
n(t) = c \cdot e^{-d\cdot t}+\beta/d,
\end{equation}
where $$c=n(0)-\beta/d$$.


## Solution

Simplest cases of pure birth process and pure death process.

- *Pure birth process*, the governing equation is, $$n(t)=b\cdot t + n(0)$$. So any numerical solution that we obtain has to follow a linear pattern of $$\beta$$ slope, for this case.
- *Pure death process*, the  governing equation is, $$n(t)=e^{-d\cdot t}+n(0)-1$$. In this case the decreasing exponential pattern has to be observed.

General equation, we obtain the asymptotic trend. With previous solution for the general problem: $$n=\beta/d$$. The concavity will depend on the sign of $$C$$.

## Stochastic Simulation Algorithm

- Two possible events might occur and these might happen at different rates: birth and death.
\begin{equation}
\frac{trial_{death}}{trial_{birth}+trial_{death}}= \frac{d\cdot N}{\beta + d\cdot N}, \qquad \frac{trial_{birth}}{trial_{death}+trial_{birth}}= \frac{\beta}{\beta + d\cdot N}
\end{equation}

- *Bernoulli Trial*. A event can either be a birth or a death. So we need to determine which event have actually occured. For this porpuse we choose a random number between $$(0,1)$$ and see if it is less than $$\frac{d\cdot N}{\beta + d\cdot N}$$ or bigger. In each case we add or subtract an individual to the population (Monte-Carlo simulation).

- For simplicity and to avoid divisions, we take a random number between $$(0, d\cdot N+\beta)$$, and we check that it is less than or greater than $$d\cdot N$$.

- Events in birth-death processes do not occur at regular time intervals. We can only say that the odds of an event occurring within any small time interval $$\Delta t$$ is equal to $$a_{0} \Delta t$$, where $$a_0$$ is the mean rate of event occurrences. A sequence of random wait times is an example of what is called a "Poisson Process."

- Wait-times between sequential events follow an exponential distribution where the probability of the next event occurring after a duration $$\tau$$ (give-or-take $$\Delta t$$) is given by:

\begin{equation}
P(\tau) = a_{0} \cdot e^{-a_0 \cdot \tau}
\end{equation}

- By *superposition property* we get that $$\tau = - \frac{\log{r}}{\beta + d\cdot x}$$. Where $$r$$ is a random number between $$(0,1)$$.<br/><br/>

## Results

- We show different simulations (blue points) for different values of birth-rate and death-rate vs theoretical solution (red line). Blue line is the mean square approximation.

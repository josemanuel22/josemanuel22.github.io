I am a Ph.D. student in Bayesian Filtering and Deep Learning Methods with a theoretical statistical perspective at Carlos III University of Madrid. Previously, I was a Software Engineer working at Devo in the loxcope team and I also worked at the European Southern Observatory as a Data engineer and at CERN Openlab Program.
My interests verse on Computational Statistics, Deep Learning, Geometric Measure Theory, Dynamical Systems, Scientific Computing and Software Engineering. My experience covers languages such as Julia, Python, Java, SQL, JavaScript ; and technologies such as Docker, ANTLR4, Kubernetes, Apache Spark, GIT or C.I. systems.
In this blog you will find posts mainly on software topics, but also on science and personal-organization.

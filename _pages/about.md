I’m currently pursuing a PhD at Carlos III University of Madrid, where I investigate the probabilistic and theoretical foundations of AI and machine learning, with a particular emphasis on Bayesian inference and measure‑theoretic statistics. Before academia, I worked as a software engineer on the Loxcope team at Devo, and served as a data engineer at the European Southern Observatory, as well as participating in the CERN Openlab program. My interests span computational statistics, deep learning, geometric measure theory, dynamical systems, scientific computing, and software engineering. I’m proficient in Julia, Python, Java, SQL, and JavaScript, and have hands‑on experience with Docker, ANTLR4, Kubernetes, Apache Spark, Git, and CI/CD pipelines.


## Research

My work centers on the probabilistic and theoretical foundations of AI and machine learning, with a particular emphasis on Bayesian inference and measure‑theoretic statistics.  
Currently, I am developing novel loss functions to enhance the training of deep neural networks. I am also expanding my research into rank statistics and their connections with optimal transport theory.
